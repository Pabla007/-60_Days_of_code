D15: Skipped this day because i have to attend Religious Funtion today.  

D[15,60] - Today i have learn how to saving & loading model 5.17 and also the read the documentation regarding it.

d[16,60] - Today i have read an aritcle for topic :- Batch Normilization and Will definately complete lesson 5 by tomorrow.

D[17,60] - I have gone through some blog's and articles related to my project and was busy in that.

d[18,60] - Today done Trasfer learning of lesson 5 and lesson is completed as it is the topic but it took almost 1 hours to train Cat and dog classification.

D[19,60] - Mostly done Project work today and also completed Coursera Week-1 Assignment and will start Lesson 6 from tomorrow.

d[20,60] - Today I have started Lesson 6 & also find the break-through for my project and from now I will be having more time to contribute in these course till I got the next proejct task.

D[21,60] - Started Lesson 6 and completed till 6.9 & I am really enjoying the way they have explained the things in this lesson.

d[22,60] - In lesson 6 completed [6.10-6.12] and really enjoyed the coding part.It just felt like i was revising Lesson 5 when doing the MLP classification Excercise.

D[23,60] - In Lesson 6 completed [6.13-6.18] & I am really enjoying the way they have explained the things in this lesson.

d[24,60] - Revision of previous concepts in Lesson 3. i.e Gradient Descent etc.

D[25,60] - Today I have done some Project work and Coursera weekly Assignment to test my Udacity Knowledge.

d[26,60] - Getting Deep into Gradient Descent Maths and now it is being cleared how the backpropogation through Derivaties is done special thanks to Andrew Ng for such a good explanation.

D[27,60] - Today I have done Coursera weekly Programming Excercise where i have implemented A simple Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset to tell whether it is cat or non-cat where I have resize, Flatten the image through numpy and also coded Cost function and updated the weights etc it is very interesting to see how to things work on the basic level as I was new to pytorch and has not done it with numpy and other libraries.

d[28,60] - Revised the lesson 6 videos till 6.20 and I will proceed the rest of vidoes from tomorrow.

D[29,60] - Completed 6.21-6.25 In lesson 6 and I really like how we calculate the edge through the kernel.

D[31,60] - Completed [6.29-6.32] In lesson 6 and read the medium post by which was really interesting.

d[32,60] - In lesson 6 I have successfully trained Capsule Network Locally but i need to understand some part of the code which i will do tomorrow and i have watched some Coursera videos. 

D[33,60] - Completed [6.33-6.35] In lesson 6 and done videos of Coursera for week 3.

d[34,60] - Completed my Coursera week 3 program it was really interesting to implement forward and backward pass and updated the weight. If anyone interested than go through it i have shared the gist link.

D[35,60] - Completed [6.36-6.37] In lesson 6 and will implement Cifar-10 solution tomorrow as i was busy in kite flying and pretty tired from it and i have also read one research paper [A deep learning framework for hyperspectral image classification using spatial pyramid pooling] .

d[36,60] - I have Skipped this day & enjoying kite flying days. And My internet was not working so i was not able to post my update yesterday. Kite flying aka Makarskranti Day is highly celebrated in Gujarat as a major festival, as a result there is 2 days holiday. During this time people enjoy flying kites, meeting family kin and kith alongwith loads of eating specials delicacies. I too enjoyed with my family and it was a memorable one.

d[36,60] - I have successfully implemented Cifar_10_cnn solution with 74% accuracy i will see tomorrow how could i increase it.

D[37,60] - In lesson 6 completed[6.36-6.38] and played with the Cifar-10 solution and will implement the augmentation solution tomorrow.

d[38,60] - Finally completed lesson 6 [6.39-6.44] though there was a lot of reading and reference material in the end. I loved the way they thought in lesson 6 because there was only notebooks in lesson 5. Will start Lesson 7 from tomorrow.

D[39,60] - Doing Coursera Week 4 in which I have wacthed the videos and done the quiz and now doing the programming assignment and will start lesson 7 from tomorrow as I have to prepare for weekly for my college which is tomorrow.
i also have to prepare for my weekly which is tomorrow.

d[40,60] - Completed Coursera Week 4 though the i was stuck at the programming excercise because i was doing silly mistakes but i was able to complete it.
