d[2,60]- Learn Pandas and compelte the course and now i have grip on the basics.

D[3,60]- Started learning about visulization seaborn from kaggle. 

d[4,60]- Completed learning about visulization seaborn from kaggle.

D[5,60]- Working on 5.8 and 5.9 and grasping basics of Pytorch .

d[6,60]- Learning ML Module course by Kaggle.

D[7,60]- Completed Ml course basics today by kaggle and I think now the dots are started to connecting with each other.

d[8,60]- setup Pytorch locally and done some programming for my final year project and researching on the satellite-image.

D[9,60]- Not able to do much today but completed till 5.3 and will implement the Fashion-MNIST tomorrow.

d[10,60] - Implemented Fashion MNIST 5.4 successfully and revised chapter 3.

D[11,60] - Started Intermediate ML course in kaggle.

d[12,60] - In Lesson 5 done notebook [5.14 to 5.16] and will try to complete lesson 5 by tomorrow.

D[13,60] - In Intermediate ML course in kaggle completed 2 lessons and did some project work.

d[14,60] - In Lesson 5 learn about dropout prons & cons and done project work and successfully merged 7 raster images into 1 raster image.

D15: Skipped this day because i have to attend Religious Funtion today.  

D[15,60] - Today i have learn how to saving & loading model 5.17 and also the read the documentation regarding it.

d[16,60] - Today i have read an aritcle for topic :- Batch Normilization and Will definately complete lesson 5 by tomorrow.

D[17,60] - I have gone through some blog's and articles related to my project and was busy in that.

d[18,60] - Today done Trasfer learning of lesson 5 and lesson is completed as it is the topic but it took almost 1 hours to train Cat and dog classification.

D[19,60] - Mostly done Project work today and also completed Coursera Week-1 Assignment and will start Lesson 6 from tomorrow.

d[20,60] - Today I have started Lesson 6 & also find the break-through for my project and from now I will be having more time to contribute in these course till I got the next proejct task.

D[21,60] - Started Lesson 6 and completed till 6.9 & I am really enjoying the way they have explained the things in this lesson.

d[22,60] - In lesson 6 completed [6.10-6.12] and really enjoyed the coding part.It just felt like i was revising Lesson 5 when doing the MLP classification Excercise.

D[23,60] - In Lesson 6 completed [6.13-6.18] & I am really enjoying the way they have explained the things in this lesson.

d[24,60] - Revision of previous concepts in Lesson 3. i.e Gradient Descent etc.

D[25,60] - Today I have done some Project work and Coursera weekly Assignment to test my Udacity Knowledge.

d[26,60] - Getting Deep into Gradient Descent Maths and now it is being cleared how the backpropogation through Derivaties is done special thanks to Andrew Ng for such a good explanation.

D[27,60] - Today I have done Coursera weekly Programming Excercise where i have implemented A simple Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset to tell whether it is cat or non-cat where I have resize, Flatten the image through numpy and also coded Cost function and updated the weights etc it is very interesting to see how to things work on the basic level as I was new to pytorch and has not done it with numpy and other libraries.

d[28,60] - Revised the lesson 6 videos till 6.20 and I will proceed the rest of vidoes from tomorrow.

D[29,60] - Completed 6.21-6.25 In lesson 6 and I really like how we calculate the edge through the kernel.

d[30,60] - Completed [6.26-6.28] In lesson 6 and i have watched Andrew NG video for more detial in CNN. 

D[31,60] - Completed [6.29-6.32] In lesson 6 and read the medium post by which was really interesting.

d[32,60] - In lesson 6 I have successfully trained Capsule Network Locally but i need to understand some part of the code which i will do tomorrow and i have watched some Coursera videos.
