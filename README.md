D[35,60] - Completed [6.36-6.37] In lesson 6 and will implement Cifar-10 solution tomorrow as i was busy in kite flying and pretty tired from it and i have also read one research paper [A deep learning framework for hyperspectral image classification using spatial pyramid pooling] .

d[36,60] - I have Skipped this day & enjoying kite flying days. And My internet was not working so i was not able to post my update yesterday. Kite flying aka Makarskranti Day is highly celebrated in Gujarat as a major festival, as a result there is 2 days holiday. During this time people enjoy flying kites, meeting family kin and kith alongwith loads of eating specials delicacies. I too enjoyed with my family and it was a memorable one.

d[36,60] - I have successfully implemented Cifar_10_cnn solution with 74% accuracy i will see tomorrow how could i increase it.

D[37,60] - In lesson 6 completed[6.36-6.38] and played with the Cifar-10 solution and will implement the augmentation solution tomorrow.

d[38,60] - Finally completed lesson 6 [6.39-6.44] though there was a lot of reading and reference material in the end. I loved the way they thought in lesson 6 because there was only notebooks in lesson 5. Will start Lesson 7 from tomorrow.

D[39,60] - Doing Coursera Week 4 in which I have wacthed the videos and done the quiz and now doing the programming assignment and will start lesson 7 from tomorrow as I have to prepare for weekly for my college which is tomorrow.
i also have to prepare for my weekly which is tomorrow.

d[40,60] - Completed Coursera Week 4 though the i was stuck at the programming excercise because i was doing silly mistakes but i was able to complete it.

d[46,60] - In lesson 8 watched the RNN video [i.e Andrej Karpathy's lecture on RNNs and LSTMs from CS231n] & it suprises me how much LSTM can do though the lecture was of 1 hour but interesting and completed my project task so will free for the next week till next task comes.

D[47,60] - In Lesson 8 completed [8.4-8.10] and it is amazing how they have teached the LSTM concept with amazing animation because of that it is easy to grasp the new things in no time.

D[53,60] - In Lesson 8 completed [8.17-8.20] and the model is training (i.e Character-Level LSTM) so i will see the result tomorrow as well as i also have to read how to choose the hypermeters and select the best model. And the instructor has so beautifully tought the RNN concepts if i would have learning from other source i would not have understand the concepts like this.And i think i will complete lesson 8 tomorrow.

d[54,60] - I have done the revision of lesson 8 before jumping to lesson 9 though 8.21 is also left. And i was busy setting the hadoop in ubuntu in VM Virtual box and install that successfully.

D[61] - Done hadoop basic practical which i have to submit tomorrow and my whole day was gone in it as I was encountered with an error.
